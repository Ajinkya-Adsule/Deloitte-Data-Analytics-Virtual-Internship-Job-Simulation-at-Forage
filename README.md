This repository contains my submission for the Deloitte STEM Virtual Program. In this program, students are asked to help Daikibo Industrials (a global leader in manufacturing of heavy machinery) with a variety of problems that they are facing.

*üíª Task 01 - Coding*
Daikibo is in the process of integrating IIoT (Industrial Internet-of-Things) devices to monitor, measure and analyze their manufacturing processes. Half of their infrastructure uses devices streaming telemetry data in one format, and the other half - in another. They need help to combine the two files.

By completing this task, I learned how to manipulate json files in Python as well as how to use unittest framework to write and run test for a python code.

*üìä Task 02 - Data Analysis*
Daikibo's tech team has converted all telemetry data collected from the 4 factories of the company:

Daikibo Factory Meiyo (Tokyo, Japan)
Daikibo Factory Seiko (Osaka, Japan)
Daikibo Berlin (Berlin, Germany)
Daikibo Shenzhen (Shenzhen, China)
Each location has 9 types of machines, sending a message every 10 min. Daikibo has been collecting this data for 1 month (May 2021) and they've just shared this data in the form of a single JSON file. The reason this client wanted to collect telemetry was to answer 2 questions:

In which location did machines break the most?
What are the machines that broke most often in that location?
By completing this task, I learned how to use the famous Analytics tool Tableau to build an interactive dashboard that helps the Daikibo's tech team to answer their questions.

*üë®‚Äçüíª Task 03 - Development*
Analyzing offline data is great, but having a real-time overview of processes and smart alerts when things break is even better. Daikibo's tech team would like us to build a real-time manufacturing status dashboard. The first task of this process is drafting a development proposal.

By completing this task, I learned how to draft a concise and convincing software development proposal.

üîê Task 04 - Forensic Technology
After a worrisome number of internal complaints about gender inequality (in terms of pay), Daikibo Industrials wants us to help them investigate. The Forensic Tech team has built an algorithm to quantify the ‚Äúlevel of gender pay equality‚Äù for most/all job roles within the company, in all company locations.

Doing this task allowed me to refresh my memory on Excel functions.

The solved excel file is uploaded in the folder here : https://github.com/Ajinkya-Adsule/Deloitte-Data-Analytics-Virtual-Internship-Job-Simulation-at-Forage/tree/8b6501639ed1c3eeb38461881308cf812e6bf4ca/Project%20Files%20%2C%20Data%20Sets%20%2C%20docs
